                    <p>Ah, Lexus, welcome back, your throne awaits. The premium Japanese car maker wins our Driver Power brand survey in 2020, and for the fourth year in a row. Other companies may be envious, but there’s no secret to Lexus’s repeated wins.
                        Owners tell us no other manufacturer builds more reliable cars, for example, nor does any offer vehicles that are built to a higher standard. Lexus owners also love the way their cars look, inside and out, with no other maker building
                        their cabins better. And once out on the road, life behind the wheel of a Lexus appears to be excellent, with the firm making brakes and steering systems that are reported to be sharp, and ensuring ride quality is comfortable.</p>

                    <p>Kia may have claimed pole position with the Sorento in our rundown of the best new cars to own, but it has to settle for silver in our brand survey. Mind you, it’s not as if Kia owners report much in the way of hardship, enjoying infotainment
                        systems that are more impressive than any other brand’s, along with immense levels of practicality, strong reliability, and cabins that are said to be well built and designed, as well as providing drivers with a good view out.

                    <p>Subaru would be in with a chance of winning our Driver Power brand survey were in not for two key points. The first concerns the company’s drivetrains, which owners of its cars say bring rather slow acceleration, together with a fair
                        amount of noise. The second major issue relates to running costs. As far as Subaru is concerned, this problem comes up frequently in our Driver Power reports, and it seems the company continues to build cars that have something
                        of a taste for fuel. But these issues are easy to prepare for, at least, and if you’re happy to do that, you’re also likely to be happy with almost everything else that relates to life with a Subaru. No other firm has better safety
                        systems, you say, while its cars are also immensely satisfying to drive, have tip-top interiors, and can be relied upon to start when you need them to. Given these results, it’s easy to see why Subaru owners tend to be a loyal
                        lot.

                    <p>Whatever Mazda is doing right now, it should keep doing it, as far as owners are concerned. Modern Mazda buyers are delighted with almost every aspect of their cars, saying that they look gorgeous, and are well screwed together. These
                        positive impressions continue inside, given cabin quality is said to be excellent, and interior styling is well regarded, too. Mazda owners also say their cars handle very nicely, come with strong safety features, and don’t cost
                        much to run. You also really like Mazda’s infotainment systems, possibly because the company has said it considers buttons and dials a better alternative to an over-reliance on touchscreen technology.</p>

                    <p>Our top-rated brand from within the Volkswagen Group, and a long-time favourite among Auto Express readers, Skoda does many, many things very, very well. No other firm builds more practical cars, for instance, with Skoda stealing the
                        limelight here once again thanks to vast boots, impressive kid-friendly features, and a wealth of interior storage spaces.</p>

                    <p>Japanese giant Toyota has cemented its reputation on affordability and reliability, but in more recent years has made a name for its hybrid tech. With around half of its European sales being hybrids, it seems owners are impressed with
                        these set-ups. Take running costs, for example: according to our data, a modern Toyota is excellent on fuel, and cheap to service. You also say the firm’s gearboxes are incredibly smooth, possibly because hybrids are linked to
                        CVT transmissions; you wouldn’t mind a bit more acceleration, though, but you can’t have everything.</p>

                    <p>Owners love how practical their Hondas are, for example, telling us the firm’s cars have huge boots and masses of cabin storage. You also say they have great safety features and are cheap to run, with servicing costs highlighted as
                        particularly low; reliability and build quality are also responsible for impressive marks. But, elsewhere, low marks creep in. Honda’s infotainment systems, for example, are poorly regarded, while the company’s cars aren’t that
                        much fun to drive, with the steering, brakes and ride quality all coming in for criticism. You wouldn’t mind a bit more oomph from the engines, either, yet Honda’s gearboxes are at least said to be smooth.

                        that please owners is their drivetrains. You say the firm makes quiet engines that pull well, even if Peugeot gearboxes are not the last word in smoothness.</p>

                    <p>There are clear parallels between Alfa Romeo and Jaguar in some regards; both firms inspire loyalty and affection in the hearts of their owners, for example, even if their cars are sometimes far from perfect. Echoes are also evident
                        in our Driver Power brand results, with Alfa owners reporting their cars are fantastic to drive. Yet while Jaguar has to settle for just fourth place here, Alfa is rated in first position in this category.

                    <p>It’s good to see that even as Volvo has joined the premium makers, it remains true to its roots, and still ranks well for safety. This was, after all, the firm that invented the three-point seatbelt and gave the patent away for other
                        firms to use. One area where Volvos of old might not have scored so well is in the interior category but here modern Volvos triumph, you say. You love the cool cabin designs, as well as how well they are put together, while also
                        reporting that rear-seat legroom is good, as is front-seat comfort.</p>
